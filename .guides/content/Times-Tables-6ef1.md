## Task
Write a program using `challenge5.py` that will output the 12 times-table. It should output 10 rows. The output should look something like this:

    1 x 12 is 12
    2 x 12 is 24
    3 x 12 is 36
    4 x 12 is 48
    5 x 12 is 60
    6 x 12 is 72
    7 x 12 is 84
    8 x 12 is 96
    9 x 12 is 108
    10 x 12 is 120

## Extension
How about improving this program so that it can output any number of rows and work for any times-table. Let the user choose these values.
